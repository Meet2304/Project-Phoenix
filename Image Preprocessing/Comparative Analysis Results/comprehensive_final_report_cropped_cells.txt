CERVICAL CANCER INDIVIDUAL CELL PREPROCESSING ANALYSIS - FINAL REPORT
Generated: 2025-08-14 10:49:45

ANALYSIS SCOPE:
- Image Type: Individual Cropped Cells from CROPPED folders
- Preprocessing combinations tested: 12
- Total cropped cell images processed: 240
- Cell categories: 5
- Samples per category: 4

OPTIMAL PREPROCESSING PIPELINE FOR INDIVIDUAL CELLS:
Method: NLM_only
Sequence: NLM
Composite Score: 0.8145

PERFORMANCE METRICS:
- SSIM: 0.9554 (±0.0214)
- PSNR: 41.09 dB (±2.32)
- Contrast Enhancement: 0.9805 (±0.0172)
- Edge Preservation: 0.1291 (±0.2784)
- Processing Time: 0.7709 seconds

RECOMMENDATION:
Implement the NLM_only preprocessing pipeline for cervical cancer individual cell 
classification to achieve optimal image quality enhancement while preserving 
critical cellular structures and morphological features.

This analysis provides definitive guidance for preprocessing optimization in 
cervical cancer individual cell image classification workflows.

IMPORTANT NOTE:
This analysis was conducted on individual cropped cell images from the CROPPED folders,
providing insights specifically for single-cell analysis rather than full slide images.
