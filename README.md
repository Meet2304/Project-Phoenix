The Phoenix is a creature of legend—consumed by flame, only to rise again from its own ashes, reborn and radiant. This project carries that same spirit into the realm of cervical cancer diagnostics. In every microscopic image lies a quiet battle between life and disease, and like the Phoenix, we believe in catching the fall before it happens. By teaching machines to recognize the earliest cellular shifts—those subtle signs of transformation—we aim to turn what could become devastation into a story of renewal. Not with myth, but with math. Not with magic, but with models. Because every early diagnosis is a chance to rise again—stronger, sooner, and with fire on your side.
